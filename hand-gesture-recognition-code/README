TechVidvan-hand_gesture_detection.py: pre trained model that we used to detect hand pose estimation. 
gesture.names: The different gesture names that the pre trained model had.  

How to install: 
pip install mediapipe 
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
Bugs: Since the model had a lot of already pretrained gestures we had to filter most of them out to be able to use the ones we needed for this project.

Future Improvements: Continue to improve accuracy of the gestures that produced by the users.
