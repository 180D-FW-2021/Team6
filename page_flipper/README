esp_flip.ino: used for page flipper with ESP32 DevKit-C
Alternatively, you can use the flip.py script for Raspberry Pi. 
  The mock_flip_commands.py test script for Raspberry Pi takes in console input ( 'f' ) and turns wheel forward accordingly.

Bugs: 
Issues with inconsistency of page flipper as it does not always flip the page correctly. 

Future improvements: 
Create a page flipping robot 
Design and print 3D-printed mounts 
Use perfboards or PCBs instead of breadboards
