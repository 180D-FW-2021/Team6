Files: 
laptop.py - Working version of user interface on the laptop end, integrating concurrent text and speech recognition
multiprocessingskeleton.py - Skeleton code for integration of concurrent tasks 


To run:
-Python3 supported. 
-Install required python libraries in hand-gesture-recognition-code and speech_tts folders.

-Run: python laptop.py 

Bugs: Performing poses before initially issuing voice commands crashes the program, caused by the shared variable between the two concurrent tasks. 

Improvements: Fix shared variable problem by utilizing mutex/semaphore.
